# üöÄ CodeQL Workflow Configuration
#
# ‚ö° Overview:
# This workflow performs static code analysis using GitHub's CodeQL to detect potential
# security vulnerabilities in your codebase.
#
# üîç Key Features:
# - üìÖ Automated Weekly Scans: Runs code analysis on a weekly schedule to ensure continuous security monitoring.
# - üîê Static Security Analysis: Applies CodeQL analysis specifically for JavaScript and TypeScript code.
# - üõ†Ô∏è Easy Customization:
#   - Adjust the analyzed languages in the `language` matrix.
#   - Add custom CodeQL queries for project-specific checks.
#   - Implement custom build logic if needed.
#
# ‚ö†Ô∏è Important:
# The languages in your repository have been auto-detected.
# Please review the `language` matrix below to ensure accuracy and completeness.
